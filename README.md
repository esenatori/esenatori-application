 # ARQ Challenge 01

Your main goal is to cloudificate and scale the following monolithic application into a 12-factor-app microservice using Docker and a container platform.

Keep in mind the service:

* should scale out n times easily
* should adapt to dynamic configurations
* object storage must be deployed in a cloud (we use AWS but we understand distributed systems have no name at all)

After finishing your task, you should provide the following items:

* transformation of monolith application into a 12-factor-app microservice application (include all changes you consider necessary)
* docker image(s)
* detailed deployment and configuration documentation
* Cloud credentials to review what have you done (Here please use free tier services)
* a few words about your solution. How does it work? Why did you choose to go that way? Why do you think this is the best approach? Would you make any changes to the application? (source code/automation), why?

Please create a GitHub/Gitlab/Bitbucket/CodeCommit public repo and share your solution with us. Repository name must follow this pattern “your-first-name-letter-surname-application”. (e.g) If Nicolas Porta submits a solution, the repo name should be “nporta-arq-application”

Anything that is not specified here is up to your criteria, taking into account all of the points mentioned above. Do not forget to include clear documentation that allows us to start and test the project locally.

We highly recommend you to use AWS Free-tier for deploying everything you need.
